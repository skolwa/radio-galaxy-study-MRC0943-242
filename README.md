# HzRG_research
Source code scripted with the purpose of analysing spectral datacubes from VLT/MUSE instrument.
The code is currently very data-specific because it is being designed as a test-bed for future analysis of HzRG VLT/MUSE data and will thus be made general.

All code developed for use in Python.
