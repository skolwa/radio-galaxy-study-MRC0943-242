# radio_galaxy_phd_project-1

## Background
This repo contains a few Python modules I used for imaging and spectral line-fitting to data extracted from a 3D datacube of a distant radio galaxy with the catalogue name, MRC0943-242 (see NASA/IPAC extragalactic database for this source for more info: https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/byname?objname=MRC%200943-242&hconst=67.8&omegam=0.308&omegav=0.692&wmap=4&corr_z=1)

The aim of this repository is to provide you with a working example of how the AstroPy and MPDAF libraries can be used on spectral and spatial analyses of a 3D datacube produced by an optical integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph - in this instance , it was the Multi-Unit Spetroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope at the ESO Observatory in Paranal, Chile. See https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html for information on the source of this data and how to access it from ESO public data archives.

The paper I published on this data analysis is available on the archive: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05114
